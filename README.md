# Spindle-Coolant-Control-System
This project implements a PLC-based control system for managing a spindle, coolant, and lamp using Simatic Manager. It automates spindle operations, regulates coolant flow in sync with spindle activity, and provides real-time status indication via lamps, ensuring efficient and safe machine tool operation.
